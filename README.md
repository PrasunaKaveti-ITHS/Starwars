## First Web JS projects using API

This is a project that you must carry out individually. 
You should use this web api: https://swapi.dev/ to download your data.

When a user browses the website, he or she must be presented with a list of "characters". 
If the user chooses to click on one of the "characters", information about him or her will
appear next to the list. Information about the selected "home"'s home plane must also be displayed.
The list of "characters" must be paginated,
and users must be able to scroll through different pages.
